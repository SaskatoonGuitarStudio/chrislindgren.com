Chris has been teaching private harp lessons in Saskatoon since 1986.
One of the first things that students need is information on where to get an instrument.
Having built two harps, Chris is in a unique position to advise beginners on what to look for in an instrument and where to find them!

Through her years of teaching experience she is well qualified to teach students proper technique to avoid injury as well as effective practice methods leading to efficient progress.
Chris has composed many pieces for the harp and frequently arranges music for her students.

Most students take weekly lessons, but other flexible lesson arrangements are possible.
Please call or email if you would like a free consultation regarding beginning the harp.
