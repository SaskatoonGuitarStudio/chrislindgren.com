Chris Lindgren has been playing harp professionally since 1983.
In the earlier years she played various festivals and concerts
across Western Canada, but now focuses on events in the Saskatoon area.
She has played for hundreds of weddings, receptions, banquets in all
the major venues in Saskatoon.

Her extensive repertoire includes timeless medieval and Renaissance melodies,
elegant classical pieces, to lively Celtic tunes.

Chris can provide her own sound system for most events.

Available on very short notice, but a week's notice or more would be appreciated.

Chris also plays in a harp-guitar duo with Saskatoon Classical guitarist, Walter Hofmeister
and they are available for weddings and background music events as well.

She can be heard on her latest CD [Harp for Dessert](/cd/).
Her first album, "Winter Harp" (1991), is no longer available.

Chris is a member of the [International Society of Folk Harpers and Craftsmen](http://www.folkharpsociety.org).
